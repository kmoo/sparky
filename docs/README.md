# sparky

Simple, responsive sparklines in Vanilla JavaScript. ðŸ“ˆ

## Backstory ðŸ“–

My goal in building this repo was not to create the perfect "Sparkline" library (see Edward Tufte's [writing on sparklines](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR) for a brief history).
Instead, my goal was to really just do a deep-dive into the native [SVGElement API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElement).

I've been building data visualizations in web apps for quite a few years now using wonderful libraries (including [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) and others!) but my knowledge of `SVG`s was basically limited to masking, injecting some custom visual elements, or putting in an ugly (and probably innefficient) hack.

After doing this little hobby project, I feel like I've have gained a nice rudimentary knowledge of the `SVGElement API` (P.S. - [here's a great tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/svg-path-syntax-illustrated-guide/) if you want to learn as well!).
However, in addition to that, I've gained a huge appreciate for the data visualization libraries out there.

My other, and less obvious goal was to make something stupid lightweight and stupid simple.
A teeny-tiny data visualization library that's both responsive and browser-compatible.

It worked! I was honestly surprised at how quickly I moved from "Hello World!" to drawing fancy little sparklines.
Who knows, maybe [`sparky`](https://github.com/kmoo/sparky) will take off?
